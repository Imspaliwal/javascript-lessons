## Object

### How to Create Object

Learn different ways to create objects in JavaScript, including object literals and the `Object` constructor.

### Object Constructor Functions

Understand how to use constructor functions to create multiple instances of objects with similar properties and methods.

### Object Prototypes

Explore the prototype chain and how JavaScript uses prototypes to share properties and methods across instances.

### Object Methods

Discover various methods that can be defined on objects and how to use them effectively.

### Object Getters/Setters

Learn about getter and setter methods to control access to object properties.

### Object Properties

Understand the different types of properties in JavaScript objects, including enumerable, configurable, and writable properties.

## Function

### Function Basics

Get to know the basics of functions, including function declarations and expressions.

### Function Parameters

Learn how to work with function parameters, including default parameters and the rest parameter.

### Higher-Order and Callback Functions

Understand higher-order functions and how to use callbacks to create more flexible and reusable code.

### Function Invocation

Explore different ways to invoke functions, including direct invocation, method invocation, and constructor invocation.

### Self-Invoking Functions

Learn about immediately invoked function expressions (IIFE) and their use cases.

### Function Call, Apply, and Bind

Understand how to use the `call`, `apply`, and `bind` methods to control the `this` context in functions.

### Function Closures

Discover closures and how they enable functions to access variables from an outer function scope.

### This Keyword

Learn about the `this` keyword and how its value is determined based on the function invocation context.
